# ASDE2019_Project

How to run the project:
1. Create a MySQL schema named "db"
2. For Neural Network part, install using pip:
  - numpy
  - tensorflow==1.15.0
  - keras
  - Pillow
3. Install Spring Tool Suite from Eclipse

In order to try the Neural Network without running the entire System (in order to check for Python setup errors), run "python .\loadModelShell.py neoB.jpg" in "ASDE2019_Project/medical-center-service/src/neural_network" from shell.
The final output should be a real number inside double square brackets.
